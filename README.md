unofficial non-commercial one-punch-man fan game.

One Punch Man is an excellent webcomic by ONE, manga by ONE and Yusuke Murata,
and anime by Madhouse studio.  (Not many conversions have approximately equal quality,
but these do!)  The playable characters used in this game are copyright those guys:

* Saitama (One punch man), over-powered bored guy with a heart.

The bosses/enemies/storylines in this unofficial fan game are original to this adaptation.

The game is a current work in progress, but will become a beat-'em-up someday.
